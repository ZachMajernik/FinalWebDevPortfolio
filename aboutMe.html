                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>
                    My name is <strong>Zachery Majernik</strong>! I was born on Nov 22nd, 2005 on Bitburg Air Force base in Bitburg Germany.
                    I am 19 years old and spent the majority of my life living in colorado, however my family did move around a bit in my early years due to my dad being in the military.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have always been a very active person, doing everything from soccer to baseball to wrestling, and now, to snowboarding and weight lifting.
                    I have also always been pretty academically inclined, especially in math, which is what led me into the amazing world of <em>programming</em>!
                    I started out like many people, coding simple little sprites on a block coding site like "Scratch" and eventually worked my way up until I made my own videogame in Unity for my 10th grade IB personal project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From that project, I realised just how much I loved coding specifically, That led me to take a data science class my senior year of highschool where I fell in love with machine learning.
                    All of that led me to pursue computer science as a career which is when I found Neumont and ended up here in the new <em>AI Engineering</em> degree path.
