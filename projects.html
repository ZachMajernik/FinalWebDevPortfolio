                <h3>World Jumper</h3>
                <p>
                    My first ever real project was a videogame I made in 9th-10th grade for my IB personal project. I made this game with C# in unity and called it World Jumper.

                <p>
                    This project was my pride and joy. I did everything from the coding, to the level design, to the art and animation. I spent hundreds of hours over six months to make the game as great as I could.

                <h3>Text Based Dungeon Crawler</h3>
                <p>
                    In my first year at Neumont, I took an Object Oriented Programing cass (OOP) and for the final I made a text based dungeon crawler where you decide a dungeon size and it is randomly generated for you. 
                    Once in the dungeon you use the console to go from room to room collecting loot and defeating enemies to find the key to make it out with as much money as possible.

                <p>
                    In less than a year, I will have to complete my degree's capstone project to show off what I have learned so far. I do not yet know what I will do, 
                    but I have a huge fascination with neural networks and will probably train one to do some fun task, maybe playing a videogame.
